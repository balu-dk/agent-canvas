 * Probe whether the selected ACP provider's CLI is already authenticated on
 * the agent-server — by a subscription login (Claude Pro/Max, ChatGPT, Google)
 * or a pre-set API key — by creating a **throwaway ACP conversation** and
 * immediately deleting it.
 *
 * The agent-server runs the ACP ``initialize`` + ``session/new`` handshake at
 * conversation start (no prompt is sent, so no model tokens are spent). That
 * handshake only succeeds when the provider CLI can authenticate, so:
 *   - create succeeds → **authenticated** (then we tear the conversation down,
 *     killing the ACP subprocess), and
 *   - create fails for any reason → **unauthenticated** (we never falsely claim
 *     "logged in"; the worst case is showing the API-key fields when they
 *     weren't strictly needed).
 *
 * This is the canvas-only "Phase 0" detection from issue #964 — it reuses the
 * existing conversation endpoints rather than a dedicated auth-status endpoint,
 * so it ships without an SDK release. It lives behind this hook precisely so
 * Phase 1 can swap the body for ``GET /acp/auth-status`` without touching the
 * UI that consumes it.
